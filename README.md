# Morse Code Translator

The purpose of this project was to create a script which can encode and decode morse code and play morse code audio. This project was inspired by Angela Yu's Udemy Course: 100 Days of Python Code. It is similar to the project listed on Day 81 of that course.

A secondary objective for me in this project was to explore using ChatGPT (the free version is 4o mini at the time of writing) to determine how effectively it could write code in this context. To that end, I got ChatGPT to complete the entire project for me, including writing tests, and have kept a log of all the prompts I gave. 

My key learning from this was that it can be extremely effective when you have a clear project scope and are able to understand the code it produces to suggest improvements of alterations that better suit your purposes. I also looked up anything which I didn't understand (e.g. I hadn't come across the PyDub module) to enhance my understanding in future projects
